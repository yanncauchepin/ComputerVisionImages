'''OpenCV provides many edge-finding filters, including Laplacian, Sobel, and Scharr. 
These filters are supposed to turn non-edge regions into black and turn edge regions 
into white or saturated colors. However, they are prone to misidentifying noise as edges. 
This flaw can be mitigated by blurring an image before trying to find its edges. 
OpenCV also provides many blurring filters, including blur (a simple average), 
medianBlur, and GaussianBlur. The arguments for the edge-finding and blurring filters 
vary but always include ksize, an odd whole number that represents the width and 
height (in pixels) of a filter's kernel.

For blurring, let's use medianBlur, which is effective in removing digital video 
noise, especially in color images. For edge-finding, let's use Laplacian, which 
produces bold edge lines, especially in grayscale images. After applying medianBlur, 
but before applying Laplacian, we should convert the image from BGR into grayscale.

Once we have the result of Laplacian, we can invert it to get black edges on a white 
background. Then, we can normalize it (so that its values range from 0 to 1) and 
then multiply it with the source image to darken the edges.'''


'''The Canny edge detection algorithm is complex but also quite interesting. 
It is a five-step process:
1. Denoise the image with a Gaussian filter.
2. Calculate the gradients.
3. Apply non-maximum suppression (NMS) on the edges. Basically, this means that 
the algorithm selects the best edges from a set of overlapping edges.
4. Apply a double threshold to all the detected edges to eliminate any false positives.
5. Analyze all the edges and their connection to each other to keep the real edges 
and discard the weak ones.'''

'''A convex shape is one where there are no two points within this shape whose 
connecting line goes outside the perimeter of the shape itself.'''

'''The first facility that OpenCV offers to calculate the approximate bounding 
polygon of a shape is cv2.approxPolyDP. The DP in the function name stands for 
the Douglas-Peucker algorithm. This function takes three parameters:
* A contour.
* An epsilon value representing the maximum discrepancy between the original contour 
and the approximated polygon (the lower the value, the closer the approximated 
value will be to the original contour).
* A Boolean flag. If it is True, it signifies that the polygon is closed.
The epsilon value is of vital importance to obtain a useful contour, so let's 
understand what it represents. Epsilon is the maximum difference between the 
approximated polygon's perimeter and the original contour's perimeter. The smaller 
this difference is, the more the approximated polygon will be similar to the original 
contour.
Now that we know what an epsilon is, we need to obtain contour perimeter information 
as a reference value. This can be obtained with the cv2.arcLength function of OpenCV.
OpenCV also offers a cv2.convexHull function for obtaining processed contour 
information for convex shapes.

"""DETECTING LINES, CIRCLES, SHAPES"""

'''The Hough transformation.
We can do this with either the HoughLines function or the HoughLinesP function. 
The former uses the standard Hough transform, while the latter uses the probabilistic 
Hough transform (hence the P in the name). The probabilistic version is so-called 
because it only analyzes a subset of the image's points and estimates the probability 
that these points all belong to the same line. This implementation is an optimized 
version of the standard Hough transform; it is less computationally intensive and 
executes faster. HoughLinesP is implemented so that it returns the two endpoints 
of each detected line segment, whereas HoughLines is implemented so that it returns 
a representation of each line as a single point and an angle, without information 
about endpoints.

The parameters of HoughLinesP are as follows:
* The binary image from Canny or another edge detection filter.
* The resolution or step size to use when searching for lines. rho is the positional 
step size in pixels, while theta is the rotational step size in radians. For example, 
if we specify rho=1 and theta=np.pi/180.0, we search for lines that are separated 
by as little as 1 pixel and 1 degree.
* The threshold, which represents the threshold below which a line is discarded. 
The Hough transform works with a system of bins and votes, with each bin representing 
a line, so if a candidate line has at least the threshold number of votes, it is 
retained; otherwise, it is discarded.
* An optional argument, lines, which we do not use here and which is not really 
useful in the functionâ€™s Python version. The lines argument can be used to provide 
a list or array in which HoughLinesP will put the resulting lines; otherwise, it 
will return a new list.
* minLineLength and maxLineGap, which we mentioned previously.

'''OpenCV also has a function for detecting circles, called HoughCircles. It works 
in a very similar fashion to HoughLines, but where minLineLength and maxLineGap

values for a circle's radius.'''

half this value as the second Canny threshold. Also, with cv2.HOUGH_GRADIENT, the 
value of param2 is a threshold for weeding out overlapping circle detections; a 
higher value leads to fewer overlapping detections.'''


'''OpenCV's implementations of the Hough transform are limited to detecting lines 
and circles; however, we already implicitly explored shape detection in general 
when we talked about approxPolyDP. This function allows for the approximation of 
polygons, so if your image contains polygons, they will be accurately detected 
through the combined use of cv2.findContours and cv2.approxPolyDP.'''
